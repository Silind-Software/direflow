#### Set up a React App and build it as a Web Component
> This setup is is based on [*react-scripts*](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts) from [*create-react-app*](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started)  
> A walkthrough of the principles used in this setup, can be read [in this article](https://itnext.io/react-and-web-components-3e0fca98a593)

## Get started

Start by downloading the cli:
```console
npm i -g direflow-cli
```

### Create a new Direflow Component
```console
direflow create
```

This will bootstrap a new Direflow Component for you.
Now use the following commands:
```console
cd <project-folder>
npm install
npm start
```

Your Direflow Component will start running on `localhost:3000` and your browser opens a new window
